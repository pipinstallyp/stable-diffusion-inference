# Stable Diffusion Inference

Welcome to Stable Diffusion Inference! This project is a python-based implementation that uses only one python file to run Stable Diffusion.


## Files

1. `stableworld.py` - This Python file takes a given prompt and generates a Stable Diffusion image.

2. `embeddings2img.py` - This Python file runs Stable Diffusion with embedding vectors as input!

## ðŸš€ Get Started

1. Run `setup.bat`. This handy script will get you up and running, installing the necessary modules for you, including the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. Activate the virtual environment by running `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.

3. Run `stableworld.py` to start the process with a given prompt.

4. `embeddings2img.py` is all you need to run Stable Diffusion with embeddings as ionput.'
